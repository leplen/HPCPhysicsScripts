# DFT and HPC scripts

This is a repository of scripts I created for doing physics research, 
especially for working with QuantumEspresso and the Torque/PBS resource manager.

Most of these are in perl, although I am considering translating several into
python as a entertaining side project.

I was the only user of most of this code and while I typically write a lot of comments,
once I got stuff working I usually stopped refactoring. As a consequence, there are likely
readability and dependency issues which aren't worth addressing until the userbase expands
to at least 2. 

Happy to deal with questions/requests,
